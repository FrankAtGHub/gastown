User said 'add LED panels' but AI asked for SKU, price, etc. instead of searching cost items.\n\n## Solution: Universal Handler with Context Injection\n\n### Frontend Context Injection\nEvery AI request includes:\n```javascript\n{\n  message: 'user input',\n  context: {\n    screen: 'inventory|estimate|workorder|customer|...',\n    selectedRecord: { id, type, data },\n    visibleRecords: [...],\n    currentFilters: { ... },\n    userPermissions: ['inventory.write', ...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### AI Behavior Changes\n1. **Search before ask** - Always search existing records before requesting manual input\n2. **Context-aware actions** - Use screen context to guide tool selection\n3. **Cross-domain operations** - Handle 'add to estimate AND update inventory' in one conversation\n4. **Record awareness** - Know what record is being viewed/edited\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1. Update frontend to send context with AI requests (AIChatPanel, EstimateAIChat, VoiceButton)\n2. Update chat.service.js to use context for tool selection\n3. Add cost item search to add_inventory_item flow\n4. Add record lookup before any 'add' operation\n5. Test: 'add LED panels to main office' should find cost item and use its data\n\n### Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/components/AIChatPanel.jsx\n- apps/web/src/components/rsb/EstimateAIChat.jsx\n- apps/api/src/services/chat.service.js\n- apps/api/src/services/ai/chatToolHandlers.js\n- apps/api/src/routes/ai.routes.js\n\n### Success Criteria\n- User says 'add LED panels' → AI finds cost item → uses existing data\n- User on estimate screen says 'add outlets' → AI adds to current estimate\n- No manual data entry for items that exist in system","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"copperhead/polecats/obsidian","created_at":"2026-01-22T23:47:02.392724068-06:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-23T00:47:29.699505037-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-23T00:47:29.699505037-06:00","close_reason":"Implemented universal context-aware handler with search-first behavior","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"co-ehry","depends_on_id":"co-wisp-2sa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T00:32:44.275803173-06:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}
