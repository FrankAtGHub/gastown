{"id":"co-xbe6","title":"Refinery: Update mayor/rig working tree after merge","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen the refinery merges a polecat's branch into main, it updates git refs (HEAD moves to new commit) but does NOT update the working tree files in `mayor/rig`. This causes:\n\n1. Files show as \"deleted\" or \"modified\" in `git status` (working tree diverges from HEAD)\n2. New files from merged commits don't appear on disk\n3. Web/API servers running from `mayor/rig` don't see the merged changes\n4. Manual intervention required: `git checkout -- .` to sync\n\n## Root Cause\n\nGit merge operations update the repository state (commits, branches) but don't automatically checkout files to the working directory when done from another location or via bare operations.\n\n## Observed Impact\n\n- Estimate UI changes merged but not visible in running app\n- Migration files missing from disk despite being in HEAD\n- Required manual `git checkout -- .` to restore files\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nAfter refinery completes a merge to main, it should:\n\n```bash\n# In mayor/rig after merge\ngit checkout -- .\n# Or more safely:\ngit reset --hard HEAD\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- Gas Town refinery merge logic (wherever merge completion is handled)\n- Possibly add post-merge hook to mayor/rig\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] After refinery merge, `git status` in mayor/rig shows clean working tree\n- [ ] New/modified files from merge are present on disk\n- [ ] Running dev servers see changes without manual intervention","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-11T05:25:53.403801423-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-11T05:25:53.403801423-06:00","created_by":"mayor"}
